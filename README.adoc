= Lgen

This is a tiny tool that does nothing more than exposing two metrics on an endpoint `<host>:8080/metrics` in
the simple Prometheus text format.

The ides is to have this as a test image for e.g. the
https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-openshift-agent[Hawkular OpenShift Agent] to simulate many running containers
 that expose metrics and which have a delay in returning due to load on the application.

== Compiling

After you got the source checked out, go to

[source, shell]
----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/pilhuhn/lgen
$ go build lgen.go
----

If you are not no Linux/amd86 you want to use evn vars to set this target


[source, shell]
----
$ GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build lgen.go
----

== Creating the image

Just run

[source, shell]
----
docker build -t <mytag> .  # <1>
----
<1> <mytag> is the image name


== Deploy to OpenShift

If you don't want to compile and use your own image, you can use mine from docker hub via:

[source, shell]
----
$ oc new-app -f deploy-lgen-openshift.yml
----

Of if you have created an image above

[source, shell]
----
oc process -f deploy-lgen-openshift.yml IMAGE_NAME=<my_tag> | oc create -f - # <1>
----
<1> <mytag> is the image name from above.
